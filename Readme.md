# Quantityland2

Quantityland2 brings more type-safety to physical simulations by providing datatypes for physical
quantities and units. It provides data-types for the most common quantities and systems of units.
It is similar to boost::units, but is written in more modern C++ and provides more stuff out of
the box.

## Features

* Type checking: Can't add a mass to a length
* Quantities of arbitrary dimension: Can multiply/divide any two quantities
* No runtime overhead: Compiles to nothing but simple doubles
* Automatic unit conversion for compatible systems of units
* Support for natural units
* Fully customizable: Create your own system of units or even your own base dimensions
* Supports arbitrary arithmetic types as basis for quantity types (e.g. complex numbers)

Missing so far:
* fractional exponents
* non proportionate units (e.g. Â°C or dB)

## Installation

* Download and unpack the project
* Open a unix-commandline and type

```
cd path/to/quantityland2
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
sudo make install
```

On Linux, Quantityland2 will install its headers to `/usr/local/include/quantityland2/`. To change
that, add `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/location/` to the `cmake` command.

## Usage

### Adding Quantityland2 to your project

To use Quantityland2, first Quantityland2 has to be found by your compiler.
If you use cmake, that's very simple. In your CMakeLists.txt, somewhere between the lines `project(...)`
and `add_executable(...)` add the line `find_package(Quantityland2)`. Then link your executable to
`Quantityland2::quantityland2`. If your executable is named mySimulation, you can link by
adding the line `target_link_libraries(mySimulation Quantityland2::quantityland2)` somewhere below
the line `add_executable(mySimulation ...)`.

If you don't use cmake, use whatever your build system provides to add `/usr/local/include/quantityland2/`
(or where you installed Quantityland2 to) to your system include paths.

### Basic usage

Most users will simply want to use Quantityland2 for defining variables with SI units.
This is the probably simplest thing you can do with this library. In your code include
`si.h` using the line `#include <si.h>` (if you didn't use cmake, you might need to prefix it with
the path relative to the default include directory, e.g. `#include <quantityland2/si.h>`).

Next, to be able to use literals, add the line `using namespace Quantityland2::SI_literals;`. Now
you have the datatypes `SI::Length`, `SI::Mass`, `SI::Time`, etc. available. Moreover, you can use
the literals `1_m`, `2.5_kg` or `1000_ms`. Alternatively, you can use the unit-constants:
`SI::units::m`, `SI::units::kg` or `SI::units::ms`.

To summarize, here is a simple application which calculates the duration of a year in seconds:

```
# CMakeLists.txt
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)

project(piTimesTenToTheSeven)
find_package(Quantityland2 REQUIRED)

add_executable(piTimesTenToTheSeven main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(piTimesTenToTheSeven Quantityland2::quantityland2)
```

```
// main.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <si.h>

using namespace Quantityland2;
using namespace Quantityland2::SI_literals;
using namespace std;

auto kepler(SI::Mass m, SI::Length a) {
    return 4*pi*pi * a*a*a / ( SI::constants::G * m );
}

int main()
{
    auto sunMass = 1.9884e33 * CGS::units::g;
    auto earthMass = 5.9723e24_kg;
    auto a = 149597870700_m;

    std::cout << "A year lasts " << root<2>(kepler(sunMass + earthMass, a)) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Using custom quantities

Generic (templated) code in C++ often comes with the drawback of very bold type names. This is
true for Quantityland2's Quantity type as well, even though we do our best to keep them as terse
as possible. If you just need to create a variable of some complex quantity type, just use **auto**
and you're done. If you need it e.g. for a function parameter, things get more complex. Quantities
that use the SI or an SI derived system have 7 integers as template parameters. They stand
- in this order - for the exponents to the dimensions mass, length, time, electric current,
temperature, amount of substance, luminous intensity.

Fortunately, Quantityland2 comes with a long list of predefined type aliases for common physical
quantities. E.g. SI::Permittivity is a type alias for
```
Quantity<SiEngine, -1, -3, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0>;
```

Still, we can't name all possible quantities, you might work with. Working with the bare, bold
quantity type identifiers is not only tedious, but also error prone (you might get weird error
messages when you specify the exponents in the wrong order)

Thus, we recommend you to define type aliases for all quantities you use regularly. By using
decltype, you can circumvent ever having to specify quantity type-names explicitly:
```
using LinearChargeDensity = decltype(SI::units::C / SI::units::m); // no need to worry about order here

// Now you can use it e.g. for function parameters
SI::ElectricCharge chargeFromAverageLineDensity(LinearChargeDensity averageLineDensity, SI::Length lineLength)
{
    return averageLineDensity * lineLength;
}
```


### Customize the numeric representation

The machine precision is best for numbers near 1.0. Thus it's common in physical simulations
to not represent numbers as multiples of SI-units, but as multiples of some characteristic
quantities of the simulation. That doesn't spoil the usage of Quantityland2, quite the opposite!
In fact, this is where Quantityland2 really shines. You will be able to express your quantities
in SI-units and still have the underlying calculation be done in multiples of your characteristic
quantities.

To allow that, we need to define, what in Quantityland2 is called an Engine. The Engine is a type,
which contains all quantity-types, unit variables and constants as static members and sub types
(Quantityland2::SI is such an engine). Don't worry, creating a custom engine is not complicated at
all!

```
using namespace Quantityland2;

struct C60Engine
{
    using NumberType = double;
    using SystemOfDimensions = SiDimensions<C60Engine>;
    using referenceEngine = SI; // allow conversion from/to SI and other SI-derived engines

    static constexpr std::tuple baseUnits { 1.1967e-24_kg, 0.14e-9_m, 1.0_s, 1.0_A, 1.0_K, 1.0_mol, 1.0_cd }; // the order is very important here!
    using units = SI_units_template<C60Engine>; // inherit basic unit constants (like m, kg, s) from SI
    using constants = SI_constants_template<C60Engine>;  // some common constants, readily represented in C60-units :)
};
using C60Quantities = SystemOfQuantities<C60Engine>;

int main()
{
    C60Quantities::Mass m1 = 1 * C60Quantities::units::kg; // or just use SI_literals and write 1_kg, thanks to
                                                           // automatic constexpr unit conversion, it's the same.
    double fullerenesPerKilo = m1 / C60Quantities::constants::m0; // m0 always corresponds to the constant used to define
                                                                  // the unit of mass, ie. 1.1967e-24_kg in this case.
    std::cout << m1 << std::endl;
}
```

## FAQ

### I don't want to always include SI::units:: before the units, but using namespace doesn't work. Why?

This is a known drawback of the chosen design. In order to achieve the desired flexibility, the namespaces Quantityland2
uses are not actually namespaces, but types. That way, we can use templates for full customizability without runtime
overhead. But it also means, that `using namespace SI::units;` can't be used. If your simulation code resides within a
custom class (or struct), you can use (multiple) inheritance to achieve the same thing, though. Thanks to empty base
class optimization, this won't add any overhead to your simulation class.
```
class MySimulation : private SI, private SI::units, private SI::constants
{
    //...
};
```

### How can I cast a quantity to a simple double?

Quantityland2-quantities don't implicitly cast to double for the good. Quantities have a member function
`numericalValue()`, though, which can be used to extract the double value out of it. Do use this method only when you
write generic code, e.g. to establish compatibility between Quantityland2 and other libraries.

In your simulations it's preferable to extract the numerical value by dividing through a unit. This is more readable
and prevents mistakes.
```
SI::Length height = ...;
double height_num = height / SI::units::m; // read: height in meters
```
